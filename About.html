        <h2 class="animate"><span class="Showright-animate"></span>Introduction</h2> 
        <p ><span class="Showright-animate"></span>Hi, I'm Keyzz or you can also call me Muhammad Miftah Nur Azizy. I was born in a small town in Indonesia, Central Java, Ambarawa City. I have various hobbies that make my life colorful, such as drawing, coding, and playing games. Since childhood, the world of graphic design and the joy of gaming has been an integral part of my life.

            Gaming is not just entertainment for me, it is also a way for me to explore new worlds, hone my tactical skills, and discover inspiring stories. I find joy and challenge in every game I play, and they often serve as a source of inspiration in my graphic design work.
            
            Apart from playing games, I also have a strong interest in the world of graphic design. Since I was in high school, I have started to be actively involved as a designer or decorator at various school events, such as sporting events, art performances and school celebrations. This experience has enriched my knowledge and skills in the field of graphic design, as well as giving me the opportunity to learn about event management and teamwork.
            
            Currently, I am pursuing my dream at one of the State Universities in Yogyakarta, known as the Blue Campus, namely Yogyakarta State University. Here, I continue to develop my skills in graphic design and information technology, while maintaining my passion and enthusiasm for gaming. My life story can be said to be unique because I believe that every experience and hobby I have had has shaped me into the individual I am today.</p>
